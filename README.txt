# Utilities: to be used adhoc to perform manual tasks.
# They include the following files:
# set_cronjob.py, builddb.py.

# Core features: 3 Scripts are to be run as cron jobs and form the 
# core of the application. They include:
# temp_guage.py (The main app), managedb.py (handles the database)
# display_tempdata.py (initiates and runs the webserver)

# The demonstration system has the database on a 58 Gigabyte partition
# Which is mounted to a directory in the root called '/database'
# This location is intentionally optional to allow for expansion. 
# However there should be a directory created mounted to the root 
# called '/database'
